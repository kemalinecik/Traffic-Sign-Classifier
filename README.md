Traffic Sign Classifier

Convolutional Neural Network to identify which traffic sign appears in a photograph. 
This involves the ability to recognize and distinguish road signs – stop signs, speed limit signs, yield signs, and more.
I used the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset, which contains thousands of images of 43 different kinds of road signs.
It is created as an exercise for me.
